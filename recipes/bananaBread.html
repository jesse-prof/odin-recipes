    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F and grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with gluten-free cooking spray.</li> 
      <li>In a large bowl, mash bananas until smooth, then stir in baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt until combined.</li>
      <li>Add eggs, vanilla extract, and your preferred sweetener, mixing well. Fold in almond flour until fully incorporated.</li>  
      <li>Transfer the thick batter to the prepared pan, smoothing the top, and bake on the center rack for about 50 minutes—oven times may vary, so keep an eye on it.</li>
      <li>Let the bread cool completely before slicing and serving.</li>
