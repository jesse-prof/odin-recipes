  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This vegetarian matzo ball soup features light, fluffy matzo balls made from homemade matzo meal, eggs, butter (or schmaltz), and seltzer, chilled before boiling. The soup base is a savory vegetable broth simmered with onions, carrots, celery, garlic, sherry or wine, and herbs like dill and bay leaves. The matzo balls are added near the end to soak up flavor, and the soup is finished with a garnish of fresh dill for a comforting and aromatic dish.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients for the Matzo Balls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups matzo meal (I prefer to buy unsalted crackers and pulse in the food processor)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon truffle salt (if you don't have truffle salt, it's okay, just use regular)</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons melted butter (you could use schmaltz, if you are not vegetarian)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup seltzer water</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Ingredients for the Soup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, roughly diced</li>
    <li>4 small carrots or 2 large, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>3 celery stalks, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sherry or white wine</li>
    <li>2 quarts Imagine "No Chicken" broth or homemade vegetable stock</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried dill</li>
    <li>Fresh dill for garnish</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pulse matzo crackers into coarse meal. In a bowl, mix matzo meal, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl, whisk
      eggs, butter, and seltzer. Combine wet and dry ingredients, then refrigerate for 1–6 hours.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Shape chilled mixture into golf-ball-sized balls, handling gently for
      lightness.</li>
    <li>Drop matzo balls into boiling water, cover, and cook undisturbed for 25–30 minutes until fully cooked.</li>
    <li>In a separate pot, sauté onions, carrots, and celery in olive oil until softened. Add sherry or wine and cook 2
      minutes more.</li>
    <li>Add vegetable stock, garlic, bay leaves, and dill. Simmer for 30 minutes, then adjust seasoning.</li>
    <li>Gently add cooked matzo balls to the soup 15 minutes before serving to soak up flavor. Garnish with fresh dill.
    </li>
  </ol>
